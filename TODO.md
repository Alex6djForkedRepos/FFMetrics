## ToDo

### Before v1.0.0
- Add colour format, colour depths and color range to displayed media info
- Show media info for processed file's as ToolTip
- Reset metrics/graphs on changing ref
- Calculate only "blank" metrics/graps. In this case it would be possible to add a file and following Calc only process this file. 'Reset' button should be used if all metrics/graphs recalculation required.
- Keep graphs colours when ticking/unticking files
- Separate graphs from main program window


### After v1.0.0
- Show warning on ref/file frame size or colour format/range mismatch
- Controls for colour format/range conversion
- Add visual controls for graphs manipulating
- NET 4.7.2 => NET Core 3.1 (to rid off Newtonsoft.Json dependency)
- Allow to process more files (>12)
- (?) Allow user to provide options for FFMpeg ("-hwaccel xyz" for example)
- (?) Publish source codes
